# SwiftPM Packages on GitHub: Statistics

> Last updated on {{ last_updated_date }}, analyzed {{ analyzed_package_count }} packages

Automatically crawled from GitHub using my [swift-package-crawler](https://github.com/czechboy0/swift-package-crawler) tool. Below I present the data with a little bit of context.

**The rate of growth is about {{ growth_rate }} new packages per day (as of {{ growth_month }}).**

## Swift versions

## Number of dependencies

## Most popular direct dependencies

## Most popular authors of direct dependencies

Please let me know what you'd like to know about the SwiftPM packages on GitHub by creating an issue. Or better, write the analyzer yourself (example of the one for [Number of dependencies](https://github.com/czechboy0/swift-package-crawler/blob/master/Sources/AnalyzerLib/DependencyTrees.swift)), PR it into the crawler and I'll add the results here!
